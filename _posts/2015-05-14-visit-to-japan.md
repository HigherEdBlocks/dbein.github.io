I visited Japan three times and each visit left lasting memories.

In May-June 2015 I was for three weeks in Japan, one week in Kyoto and two weeks in Chofu, near Tokyo. While living in Kyoto, I visited two collegues at Osaka University, several temples in Kyoto, the cities of Kobe and Arima; one more beautiful than another. While living in Chofu, I worked with one colleague at the University of Electro-Communications and visited Tokyo (for the first time).
