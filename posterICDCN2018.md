title: Call for Posters 2018 ICDCN
---

### Poster Chair: Dr. Doina Bein, dbein@fullerton.edu
#### Deadline for poster submission: Friday, October 6, 2017

The ICDCN poster session showcases works-in-progress in an informal setting. Topics of interest are the same as research topics in the ICDCS 2018 conference call for papers but also exciting new topics and applications in the field. We strongly encourage student and industry submissions. Presenting a poster at ICDCN 2018 is a great opportunity, especially for students, to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from experts in the field, attending the conference.

The ICDCS Poster Committee will review all poster proposals and send notifications of accepted posters. Poster presenters must be registered for the conference using the (reduced) student registration rate. Each full or student registrant for ICDCN 2018 is allowed to have one poster registration for free.

1. The submission consists of two steps: first completing a Google Form

with the basic information of the registrant: full name, email address, affiliation, other contact information, as well as title of the work and a single‚Äêsentence summary that introduces the achievements of the work (50 words or fewer). The registrant will receive a reply email containing the link to a private Google drive will be sent out, where he/she can upload the poster. 
2. Submission content: the submission must include the following materials and information:  
One "representative image": This image should be suitable for possible use in the conference web site and promotional materials. 
Statement of permissions to use the submitted materials. This assures ICDCS 2018 that you own the rights to your materials or have permission to use them.
Poster abstract: An abstract (two pages maximum) describing your work (PDF). The abstract should include what area you are working in, what is novel about your work, and how this work relates to previous work on the same topic.
Submission categories and keywords: You will be asked to tag your submission with appropriate keywords to help ensure your submission is reviewed and juried appropriately. 
3. Deadline for submission: Friday October 6, 2017 
4. Evaluation: After your work is submitted, it is reviewed by a panel of experts of varying backgrounds. Each reviewer evaluates the posters independently before meeting to discuss their evaluations and make recommendations to the final selection committee. 
5. Deadline for receiving the evaluation: Monday October 16, 2017 
6. Deadline for submitting the poster as a PDF file of accepted posters: Monday October 23. A poster is usually A0 paper size in portrait mode (841 x 1189mm). If your poster is larger, please inform the Poster Chair.

Use the reduced registration rate for poster only registrant, equal to the student rate registration for ICDCN 2018. Submit the registration confirmation to the Poster Chair.
