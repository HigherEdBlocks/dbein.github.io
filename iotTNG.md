## 17th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations, April 5-8, 2020, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

### Track organizers: Dr. Doina Bein (dbein@fullerton.edu)
#### Deadlines
Check [__here__](http://www.itng.info/index.php) for paper submission

### Scope:
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) refer to trends in integrating digital capabilities, including network connectivity, with physical devices and systems. Examples of such systems range from
intelligent vehicles and smart grids to advanced manufacturing systems and wearable medical devices, and create economic growth in sectors ranging from
energy and transportation to health care, agriculture, public safety, and smart cities. 
The conference features keynote speakers, a best student paper award, best poster award, best service award, a PhD student forum and workshops/exhibits from industry, government, and academia.

### Topics:
* Control of CPS
* Cyber-physical multimedia systems and applications
* Experimental prototypes of CPS
* IoT (Internet of Things) Architecture: novel information architecture design on field, edge, and cloud devices; object access and networking technology; investigation of technologies that support the mobility of functions and executions across system entities.
* Interoperability of IoT Systems: service discovery and composition; synchronization in distributed systems; semantic data description frameworks.
* IoT Interactions: novel methods and techniques for seamless human-to-object and object-to-object interactions, including augmented reality and virtual reality interactions.
* Physical World Event Processing and Understanding: novel data collection, deep learning, reality mining, and prediction methods based on physical world observations; real-time decision making, event processing, and extracting information from large datasets.
* Security and privacy of CPS: cryptographic protocols and algorithms for CPS or IoT devices; data integrity, authentication, and access control for smart CPS; security in smart grids/smart homes/smart cities/smart transportation; security threat detection theories and technologies; cloud based secure smart CPS; privacy issues in smart grids/smart homes/smart cities/smart transportations
* Social Acceptance of IoT Systems: data security, authentication and authorization; privacy protection, data sharing technologies (incl. blockchain technology); tampering protection and detection in IoT systems.
* Use case and user study of CPS
* Web Technologies for the IoT: web-based discovery, search, and service composition to facilitate interactions between devices on the IoT and with users.

### Paper Submission:
Papers should be original and contain contributions of theoretical or experimental nature, or be unique experience reports. Interested authors should submit a 6-page summary of their original and unpublished work including 5 keywords in the standard IEEE format to the track chair. Electronic submission in the PDF, PS or MS Word format is strongly encouraged. For electronic submissions, Click [__here__](http://www.itng.info/submission.php). Selected papers presented at the
conference will be considered for publication in a special issue of an international journal. Confirmed Journals are:
1. Journal of Information, 2. Intâ€™l Journal of Hyperconnectivity and the Internet of Things (IJHIoT).

### Evaluation Process:
Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and soundness. Per ITNG policy, except for invited papers, all papers will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in the conference proceedings.

### Best Student Paper:
The Best Student Paper will be awarded at the conference. To be eligible, the student must be the sole author of the paper, or the first author and primary contributor. (The winner of the award will present the paper in a plenary session at the conference). A cover letter to the General Chair/Track Chair must identify the paper as a candidate for this competition at the time of submission.
